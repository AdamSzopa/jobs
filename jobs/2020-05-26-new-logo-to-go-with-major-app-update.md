AntennaPod is a podcast manager and player for Android. Contrary to many of its competitors, it is open source (MIT License), developed and translated by volunteers, gratis and ad-free.

The appâ€™s current main developer is currently working on **AntennaPod version 2**, an important update with lots of bug fixes and UI improvements.
