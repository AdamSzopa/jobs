Hi! Our team needs someone proficient in WordPress to help implement our wireframes for a geriatric care website. 

Creative Care Management is a geriatric care company. They are in need of a complete website redesign. My team consists of three UX/UI designers. It is a simple website, essentially a static landing page (some top-level pages and subpages). Content includes resources, about the company, a contact form, and blogs.
