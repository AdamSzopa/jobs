Hey. =^.^=

[Value Flows](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows) is an open source project to help a lot of alternative economic software projects that are solving different pieces of the same puzzle be able to work together.

We're interested in collaborating with open source designers who share our vision, who can help us to more effectively communicate our vision through visual design.

As a first step, we [started a thread for our logo](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues/38). If you're interested, join in the conversation there, participate in our [other conversations](https://github.com/valueflows/valueflows/issues), or message @ahdinosaur directly. :)
