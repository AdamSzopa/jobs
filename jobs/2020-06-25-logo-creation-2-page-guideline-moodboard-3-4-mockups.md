I am the new owner of a coffee shop in West London : Marry, and I need a nice brand identity for my venue.
I basically need a logo with a brand guideline (2 pages would be great) so I can get inspired in the future with my social media & website to follow a nice path and also a few examples / mock ups (tote bags - cups - coffee pouches).
Please feel free to send me an e-mail if you need more information :)
