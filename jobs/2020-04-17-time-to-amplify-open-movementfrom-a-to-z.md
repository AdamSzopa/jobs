It is Hu, a freedom enthusiast software developer, who believes in Privacy and digital rights as well. In next few lines I respect your time and try to explain my project as simple and fast as possible. 
The project idea came form some critical questions I always think about. Such “why The good sides of societies are forced to be separated islands with poor power and weak voice?” Why They can not resonate and amplify each other? There must be some system to integrate all effort of all good faith and make up an effective power to improve human life. 
And some other questions like, how long last open software movement? Hence commercial software are getting more and more sophisticated and user friendly with unlimited power on controlling user’s data, privacy, even habits.

What about open science, open technology and open money? Do we have any plan to reach? 

Why the benevolent people in the world have to count on small donations and suffer from lack of fund? Why they do not have a general value-presenter to share together all through the world? This value-presenter presents that the owner was did something good for the world (e.g. developed an open source software, or feed an elephant in Africa), And because of that good job she/he/organization earned a certain amount of coins. So if you have that coins I willingly accept your coin and in return offer you my services or goods, because these coins have intrinsic value and are armed by good faith and everybody must be proud of having these coins. 

Fortunately we have blockchain technology and cryptography, so we can run a decentralized system which governs by no one except who did something good for world. Who did it can be a member and can vote on membership of new members and so on. Having these technology and a little programming skills and dedicating enough time (2 years), I created this crypto-value system called “imagine”. It comes from the famous song by John Lennon you should now. BTW imagine works like that. You install and run an imagine client. You connect to imagine’s network. And browse the TODOs list. There are tons of technical/non-technical issues to do. If you are agree & can & like to do some of them simply do it (or dedicate small amount of time to carry out, even small step) and be a contributor. Or if you think there is something more important to do, simply propose it and hopefully someone will do it for you (and implicitly for the world). 
At the end of the day we will integrate all goodness of open-software, privacy tools, social network… 
No single small project will be abandoned any more. All will be forever on blockchain and time by time, the brand-new contributors pushing it forward continuously. 
“imagine” is all about sharing good faith to make the world a better place, as it deserves. It is deployed for the common good.

P.S.
If you like the idea but you haven’t enough technical skills to run a node, please ask help from your friends/professionals… I think it worth. For you, for us, and for our children.

Some technical notes:
- The software is & will be open and free
- imagine does not use Prof of Work(PoW), instead uses PoS which I prefer interpret it to Proof of Solidarity in which who dedicates more time for community and world, earns more.
- The data structure used by imagine is DAG, so it is better to call it a graph-chain instead of blockchain. Using DAG empowers imagine to be scalable and validate million of transactions per seconds. The famous double-spending problem is resolved by customized CAP theorem. You can read more on imagine’s wiki.
- at the moment imagine supports M-of-N-Multi-Signature-Transaction which is imagine’s general transaction. Regards to imagine’s architecture it is easy to add new type of transaction supporting. e.g. MimbleWimble or ZKSnarks...
- in order to being really censorship-resistant, and really decentralized, imagine uses email as a carrier (not TCP/IP and port connections). It looks crazy but it works perfectly, and in our customized implementation it is even more scalable than TCP/IP! Thanks free speech defenders we still can have anonymous email without reveal our identity which is not possible with static IPs or even dynamic IPs. 
- again in order to being really censorship-resistant, and really decentralized, imagine has it’s own Flexible name service (FleNS, by which you can register any combination of letters e.g. email, nickname, weird IDs…) and use this address for payments, sending messages, wallet communications, redirect visitors to a host IP address… these registered iNames can not be ceased by no authority and will be ONLY under your control for ever.
- also imagine has it’s embedded distributed wiki and embedded distributed discussion forums.
- once again in order to being really censorship-resistant, and really decentralized, imagine uses block-graph to maintain source code history (pretty much like a source version control software) and planned to have it’s own full-fledged decentralized version control software as an optional plugin for clients. So imagine does not use GitHub or any other version control system as repository. Developers can download code changes by exploring block-graph and can use whatever version control on their local machine.
- entire communication between nodes are encrypted by iPGP (user friendly implementation of PGP).
- because of the way imagine is designed, users can register any type of data(text, media, binary, BLOB...) in block-graph.
- imagine is implemented in JavaScript in order to have more code readability and vast contributors community. The related technologies are Node.js, Angular(probably will be replaced by vue.js), postgresql(can be changed to other relational DBs). So the installation and running a full-node will be very fast and easy, even for non experienced C++ developers.
- by running an imagine  full node, you will have a client which communicate to imagine’s network through imagine’s protocol, and a web interface to manage your wallet and explore blocks/transactions/documents, vote for proposals or propose an idea, register your desired iName, participate in discussions...
- imagine planned to develop it’s mobile app, which will support entire desktop functionality, specially messenger and discussion Forums.
