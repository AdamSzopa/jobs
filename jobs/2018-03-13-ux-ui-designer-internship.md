Zamphyr Internship Program is an opportunity to be a part of a revolutionary startup set out to change technology education as we know it. You will be working on open-source technologies in education, improving our platform and spreading the vision of universal educational change to people and developer communities.

This internship is an unpaid, remote, project-based program, lasting 3 months (up to 6 months if required by accepted interns). Accepted interns work part-time (20 hrs/week) on projects or initiatives with mentors. Internship is remote and we give each intern an important part of the ecosystem through the project. The program is international and a great opportunity to meet new friends from all around the world. We use Slack, Zoom, Gitlab, Trello and Google Docs for the best remote workflow.

Our capacity for this program is very limited, and it is most likely that we will pick only one candidate for each position offered. Applicants will be evaluated for their past achievements, ideas and culture fit.
