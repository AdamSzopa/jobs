FSFE is a charity that empowers users to use technology and that spreads Free Software.

We are looking for a #FreeSoftware #designer or #layouter, who knows #Scribus and likes to help out @fsfe PR section for some â‚¬ and a lot of Karma. To get an impression, you can find our material here: https://fsfe.org/contribute/spreadtheword

Your job is to transform our Inkscape defaults into Scribus and layout the Scribus-version for every translation. We pay 40 Euro for each item (= layouting one translation of a leaflet).
