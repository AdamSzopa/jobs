[Nuspell](http://nuspell.org) is a [MOSS](https://www.mozilla.org/moss)-sponsored reimplementation and improvement of the spell checker [Hunspell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunspell). Hunspell is currently used in almost all web browsers, office packages, IDEs and other text editors. It supports over 80 languages and is included in software from Adobe but not by any software from Microsoft.

In short, this spell checker is used all over the world by billions of people. However, since it is used mainly in an integrated way in other software, it doesn't have a face. It is not visible. In order to raise awareness that spell checking is offered by Nuspell, so that more people can contribute in the development and extend language support, we need Nuspell to have an image.

The logo will be used on the website, articles, add-on icons, as avatar on mainstream social media and as avatar on social software development websites. The avatar usage requires that a circled cropped version must still be recognizable. A color scheme of a main color and two supporting colors should all have a good contrast amongst each other and with white and with black so these colors can be used for the website.

The website will be simple with static info, see http://hunspell.github.io  and doesn't need special design from this job. Maybe the website will offer ad hoc spell checking if we find a sponsor for a server. See the website from the grammar checker [LanguageTool](https://languagetool.org) on how that might look.

See [Inkscape Open Symbols](https://github.com/Xaviju/inkscape-open-symbols) for reference ideas. Some keywords that might help are:
- spell checking, spell checker or spelling checker
- writing aid, writing tool or language support
- internationalization and localization
- command-line
- shared library
- abstract service
- platform-independent

We, and others, intent to use the logo in e.g. PNG 16x16, 22x22, 24x24, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 192x192, 256x256 and 512x512 pixels. Only the color version may have shading, but not on the background as is found in [Material Design](https://material.io/icons)'s [guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines).

Feel free to inquire about more background information. Nuspell is being developed within the Hunspell community. The maker of the logo will be recognized and credited as such, the FOSS copyrights will be managed within the Nuspell project.
